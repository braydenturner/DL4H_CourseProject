## Running The Code
All the code is contained in a Jupyter notebook (Project.ipynb). At the very top is a cell to import some of the modules we used (Sparsemax, numpy, etc.).

### Flags 

There are two flags that can be used to control operation of the notebook:

`use_demo` specifies whether or not the demo data should be used. Use this setting if you do not have the MIMIC-III dataset stored locally

`print_metrics` specifies whether or not metrics should be printed. Metrics include CPU utilization, RAM utilization, and GPU VRAM utilization.
